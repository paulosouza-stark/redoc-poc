      Pix Requests are used to receive or send instant payments to accounts hosted in other Pix participants.

      Inbound Pix Requests will be automatically created whenever you receive an instant payment, but their completion will depend on your authorization response.

      Authorization requests will be sent whenever you receive an inbound Pix Request. To receive and respond to authorization requests, you must register a url of your choice where they will be forwarded to.

      If there is no authorization url registered, all inbound Pix Requests will be denied by default.
  - name: Pix Reversal
    description: |-
      Pix Reversals are instant payments used to revert Pix Request. You can only revert inbound Pix Requests.

      Inbound Pix Reversals will be automatically created whenever you receive an instant payment reversal, but their completion will depend on your authorization response.

      Authorization requests will be sent whenever you receive a Pix Reversal. To receive and respond to authorization requests, you must register a url of your choice where they will be forwarded to.

      If there is no authorization url registered, all inbound Pix Reversals will be accepted by default.

  - name: Pix Infraction
    description: |-
      Pix Infractions are used to report transactions suspected of fraud, request reversals or chargeback reversals.

      Pix Infractions can be created by either participant of a transaction. After created, the receiving party must analyse the infraction and close it by agreeing or disagreeing.
  - name: Pix Chargeback
    description: |-
      A Pix Chargeback can be created when fraud is detected on a transaction or a system malfunction results in an erroneous transaction.

      If the reason for the Pix Chargeback is "fraud", it must be created only after a Pix Infraction regarding the same transaction has been agreed and closed.
  - name: Pix Domain
